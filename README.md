# Multiplicative Reduction of an elliptic curves with a non-trivial odd torsion point
This repository contains the code that verifies results in Section 2 of the paper *Representations attached to elliptic curves with a non-trivial odd torsion point* by Alexander Barrios and Manami Roy. The codes are written by the authors as well.


This code was written on SageMath, and the repository consists of 4 files:

(1) torsion_parameterization.sage

(2) Verification_for_C3_C5_C6.ipynb

(3) Verification_for_C7_C9_C10.ipynb

(4) Verification_for_C12_C2xC6.ipynb

File (1) contains the definitions that are called by (2), (3), and (4).


Files (2), (3), (4) contain the verification for Lemma 2.1 and Theorem 2.2.
